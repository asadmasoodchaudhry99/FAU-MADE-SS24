# Project Plan

## Title
Investigating the Relationship between Agricultural Production and Climate Change Over the Years

## Main Question
1. What is the relation between the Agricultural Production and Climate Change over the years?

## Description

This project seeks to provide actionable insights into the relationship between agricultural production and climate change over the years. By analyzing historical data on climate change indicators and agricultural production metrics, I aim to identify the effect of climate factors on crop yields and production volumes. This analysis will help farmers, policymakers, and stakeholders understand the impact of climate change on agriculture and develop strategies to enhance agricultural resilience and productivity in the face of changing climate conditions.
